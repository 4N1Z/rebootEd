      <h1>Sree Chitra Thirunal College of Engineering</h1>
      <p>
        The Government of Kerala established the Sree Chitra Thirunal College of
        Engineering (SCTCE), Thiruvananthapuram in memory of the Maharaja of
        Travancore Sree Chitra Thirunal Balarama Varma. It is affiliated with
        the KTU University, and has approval from the AICTE. With only around
        ten engineering colleges operating in Kerala during the 1990s, the
        Government of Kerala wanted to set up another institution under its
        control to nurture top quality engineers in the state, which were in
        demand, and this led to the formation of SCT. SCT is the first college
        in South India to offer a B.Tech. programme in Automobile Engineering
        and it was one of the few colleges that got accredited in early 2000.
